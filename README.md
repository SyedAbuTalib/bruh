# bruh.
Don't you hate it when git tells you to `git push --set-upstream origin [branch_name]`!?  Like bruh.

Just put this small script into your .zshrc (or .bashrc if you're into that)! Whenever the terminal tells you to `git push --set-upstream origin [branch_name]` just type  `bruh` and watch the magic happen : ).

## Usage
The screenshot added shows the usage:
