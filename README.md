# bruh.
Don't you hate it when git tells you to `git push --set-upstream origin [branch_name]`? bruh.

All you have to do is run `ruby setup.rb` and the script will end up in either your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`.
Or you can just copy and paste from the `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` files that were provided.

## Time Saved
I averaged about 5.6 seconds to copy and paste, whereas typing bruh took me approximately 1 second. Assuming that I save 4.6 seconds every time I write `bruh` instead of typing the whole git line, I save around 232.05 seconds in one work week. If I had worked for 50 weeks, that ends up being 11602.5 seconds, or **193 minutes a year**.
