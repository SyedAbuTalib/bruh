# bruh.
Don't you hate it when git tells you to `git push --set-upstream origin [branch_name]`!?  Like bruh.

Just put this small script into your .zshrc (or .bashrc if you're into that)! Whenever the terminal tells you to `git push --set-upstream origin [branch_name]` just type  `bruh` and watch the magic happen : ).

## Usage
The screenshot added shows the usage:

## Time Saved
I averaged about 5.6 seconds to copy and paste, whereas typing bruh took me approximately 1 second. Assuming that I save 4.6 seconds every time I write `bruh` instead of typing the whole git line, I save around 232.05 seconds in one work week. If I had worked for 50 weeks, that ends up being 11602.5 seconds, or **193 minutes a year**.
